# Amity-Communications
Group Project for both a computer networks(v1) and network security(v2) in 2019. The original system was designed to be a windows based user friendly group chat interface featuring TCP protocol and an interactive/pleasing graphical user interface. The upgraded system featured RSA data encryption and a client/server group chat key infrastructure to add layers of security. The system also featured distinct user profiles.
These programs were written using Windows Forms in C#. THIS IS NOT THE FULL PROGRAM FILE BUT A BACKUP OF PRESENTATIONS, REPORTS, AND SOURCE CODE.
